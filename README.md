## Example Sudoku Game in React

A front-end project to develop a singular Sudoku game.

This is developed for live performance but also to develop my skills in React.

User stories:

As a player, I want to see a starter board, so I can work out my first move.

As a player, I want to be able to enter a number, so I can progress in the game.

As a player, I want the number to show me if I was right, so I don't get too lost in the game.

Using:

React
Node.js
Javascript
Webpack
Babel

Working from the principle of Minimum Viable Product:
 - a singular sudoku game that can be played interactively.
